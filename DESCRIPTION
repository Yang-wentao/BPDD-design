Description: The BPDD package provides tools for Bayesian data augmentation in the context of delayed outcomes in Phase I/II clinical trials. The package implements a platform for efficiently handling delayed response data, applying Bayesian methods to model and augment missing or incomplete outcomes. It facilitates the analysis of cohort sizes, treatment effects, and prior distributions, supporting the development of robust statistical models for early-phase clinical trials. With built-in functions for data simulation, model fitting, and result visualization, BPDD enables researchers to conduct comprehensive analyses of delayed clinical outcomes.
